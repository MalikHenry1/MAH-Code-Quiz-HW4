# MAH-Code-Quiz-HW4
This repository contains code for a timed quiz application that saves high scores and tracks user progress.

In this project, I have created a timed coding quiz that saves the users submissions to Local Storage, decrements time if the user enters an incorrect answers, and displays the high scores on the final screen.
